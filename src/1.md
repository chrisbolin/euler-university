# Problem 1

## Bruce force solution

This problem can be solved with "brute force" pretty easily. We could loop over
the natural numbers from 1 to 999 and sum them if they meet the criteria. This
solution's execution time would scale linearly with the number of numbers to
evaluate. We could state this a little more formally in Big O notionation

```
T(n) = O(n)
```

This solution may be acceptable for small numbers, but we might want to be more
creative as n grows.

## Constant-time solution

Consider the sum of the digits, 1 through 9.
