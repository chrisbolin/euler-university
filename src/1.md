# Problem 1

## Bruce force solution

This problem can be solved with "brute force" pretty easily. We could loop over
the natural numbers from 1 to 999 and sum them if they meet the criteria. This
solution's execution time would scale linearly with the number of numbers to
evaluate. We could state this a little more formally in Big O notionation.

```
T(n) = O(n)
```

This solution may be acceptable for small numbers, but we might want to be more
creative as n grows. Let's look at summations.

## Summations

Consider the sum, _S_, of the digits 1 through 9.

\\[ S = \sum_{i=1}^{9} i \\]

Enumerate the digits and group them so that each group has the same sum.

\\[ S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 \\]

\\[ S = (1 + 9) + (2 + 8) + (3 + 7) + (4 + 6) + 5 \\]

\\[ S = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 \\]

\\[ S = 4 \cdot 10 + 5 \\]

\\[ S = \cfrac{9 \cdot 10}{2} \\]

\\[ S = \cfrac{9 \cdot (9 + 1)}{2} \\]

We won't prove it here, but this finding can be generalized.

\\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \cfrac{n \cdot (n + 1)}{2} \\]
